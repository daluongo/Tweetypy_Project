Putting in all together:  Working as a team

Below is some insight of how Tweetypy began working on project1.


Project Title:  Everybody Loves Maps:  What migration maps/charts tell us about the relationship between gentrification and the impact of equity in DC public schools? Gentrification   

Hypothesis: As D.C. Grows More Diverse, Public Schools Remain Racially Segregated
Project Description/Outline:
Use maps and other charts to paint a picture of DC community gentrification and linked student segregation/migration.

Outline
This is happening:  Map DC community gentrification are housing cost or income data over past 50 years
Effect on focus group:  Map K-12 School migration in gentrification communities: minority vs non-minority rate over past 50 years
Show me the data: Intra- and inter-community migration patterns of minority/non-minority students to private, public, charter schools in/near these communities

Original Research Question(s) to Answer (these are subject to change)
What is the gentrification trend over the past 10-15 years in DC Proper?
What are the schools (public, private, charter) in/around these communities and the percentage of minority to non-minority students at these schools over the past 10-15 years?
How does the relationship between gentrification and segregation change the student diversity make-up at k-12 schools?

Data Sources/Sets We Can Start With:

Note: Equity Vs. equality: Equity is giving everyone what they need to be successful. Equality is treating everyone the same.

Hypothesis/ Question: 
What migration maps/charts tell us about the relationship between gentrification and the impact of equity in DC public schools? Gentrification  

As D.C. Grows More Diverse, Public Schools Remain Racially Segregated

Gentrification: the process of renovating a district so that it conforms to middle-class taste. A general term for the arrival of wealthier people in an existing urban district, a related increase in rents and property values, and changes in the district's character and culture. Suggests the displacement of poor communities by rich outsiders.

To be considered gentrified in DC, a Ward’s median household income and median home value needed to fall within the bottom 40th percentile of all ward’s within DC from the beginning of the decade (used data from 2000 and 2016). 


Elements to Explore: 
1)	Housing Prices – we expect housing prices to have increased exponentially in areas we are defining as “gentrified” 
a.	Increase in rents (broken down by neighborhoods or wards)
b.	Property values (broken down by neighborhoods or wards)
2)	Median Household Income – we expect the median household income to increase, as wealthier outsiders move to gentrified areas and displace poorer communities
3)	Education Level [maybe?] – a higher level of education is generally tied to higher income later in life – perhaps this could make an impact on the process of gentrification, as well

Ideas for Data Visualization:
1)    Line graph to represent median household income changes over time
2)    Heat map to show the percentage change of housing prices over time
3)    Heat map to show median household income
4)    Scatter plot to represent education level clusters (?)

To be eligible to gentrify, a ward’s median household income and median home value needed to fall within the bottom 40th percentile of all ward’s within DC at the beginning of the decade (1999-2016)

-- DC neighborhoods used to be low income / minority 
-- then socioeconomic factors drove the old residents out and new richer / young residents in 
- housing prices go up and low income/minority residents get priced out to PG County suburbs 
--- show Median income / age / race demographics to show these trends

What is impacting the equity in DC public schools?
Access to transportation
Costs of education


Equity: the concept or idea of fairness in economics, particularly in regard to taxation or welfare economics. More specifically, it may refer to equal life chances regardless of identity, to provide all citizens with a basic and equal minimum of income, goods, and services or to increase funds and commitment for redistribution.


Dart Tips 

• Child population by neighborhood
        ○ Use Child Count Data Set 
https://datacenter.kidscount.org/data/tables/8874-race-ethnicity-of-child-population-by-ward?loc=10&loct=3#detailed/3/any/false/870,573,869,36,868,867,133,11/3498,2161,2159,2157,2663,3499,3307|/17761,17762

    • Schools within neighborhoods 
        ○ Find a data set that includes public schools, charter schools, and non-public schools
        ○ Also include address information
https://ocrdata.ed.gov/flex/Reports.aspx?type=school 


    • Student enrollment within schools
○ Consider scraping from a good source, such as MySchoolsDC, provided that the data is available
        ○ Look for enrollment data: https://nces.ed.gov/programs/edge/TableViewer/acsProfile/2017 (public & private)
