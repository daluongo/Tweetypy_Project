Gentrification and DC Schools
 
Our group analyzed gentrification trends in DC over time to see if a correlation between proxies of gentrification and school enrollment exists. Gentrification can be loosely defined as the arrival of wealthier individuals to an urban area, which can lead to an increase in housing prices and property values; eventually, this can lead to the displacement of poorer communities. To be considered gentrified in DC, a Ward’s average household income and average home value needed to fall within the bottom 40th percentile of all ward’s within DC from the beginning of the decade (used data from 2000 and 2016). Our project focuses on three main questions regarding gentrification in DC and its effect on school data from 2000 to 2016. Please find a summary of our findings as follows. 
 
Which Wards in DC have been affected most by gentrification? 

We examined median household income and median home value to establish which wards were eligible to gentrify. Should these two elements fall within the bottom 40thpercentile of all wards within DC at the beginning of the decade, they can be classified as eligible to gentrify (governing). We created several visual representations to determine in which wards gentrification by this definition existed. Referencing specifically the bar charts with percent change in average housing prices and percent change in income by ward, as well as the two heat maps, there is clear evidence showing which wards had the most gentrification. Wards 1, 5, 6 had the largest percent changes in average housing prices, and wards 1, 5, 6 had the largest percent changes in income. Thus, in descending order, wards 1, 6, 5, 4, 7, 8, 2, 3 had the most gentrification present. 
 
2.    What are the schools (public, charter) in/around these communities and the percentage of students at these schools over the past 10-15 years? 
 
We looked at the breakdown of DC Public Schools (DCPS) v charter schools, and we discovered that there is less charter school enrollment in more gentrified wards. We specifically compared Wards 1 and 6 (highly gentrified) and Ward 3 (least gentrified) to gain perspective on what different wards with different levels of gentrification might look like. 

3. Does gentrification make an impact on where students choose to enroll in school?
 
We found some correlation between the ward students go to school in versus the ward they live in. For example, Wards 1 & 6 are highly gentrified and show lower enrollment within their respective wards. Conversely, Wards 7 & 8 are not gentrified and have the two highest rates of same-Ward student enrollment. However, the correlation does not imply causation, as we would need to run more statistical analysis on this front.
